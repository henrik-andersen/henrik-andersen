Academic Assistant | University of Technology Chemnitz | Institute of Sociology

I am a postdoc at the University of Technology Chemnitz, Institute of Sociology. My interests include structural equation modeling and longitudinal and panel analysis. I am currently working on projects related to fear of (migrant) crime and right-wing populism, as well as environmental attitudes and behaviours. Previous projects have focused on experimental survey methods for validly measuring sensitive attitudes and behaviours.
