I am currently working on my doctoral thesis which is on panel regression in the structural equation modeling framework. I am also interested in and have worked on projects focusing on social desirability bias and pseudo-opinions in surveys.  

The files for my most recent articles can be found on github:

Andersen, H. K. (2021). [Equivalent Approaches to Dealing with Unobserved Heterogeneity in Cross-Lagged Panel Models? Investigating the Benefits and Drawbacks of the Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals and the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model](https://github.com/henrik-andersen/equivalent-approaches-clpm). Accepted to [Psychological Methods](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/met).
